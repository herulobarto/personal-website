This project is a full duplicate of the Tesla website that I designed and built using Figma. By precisely replicating the UI/UX design of the Tesla website, I managed to create an elegant, minimalist, and responsive user experience. Every element, from the navigation structure, to the full-screen visuals, to the smooth transitions, I designed in meticulous detail to reflect the high quality and standards of the design.

The project started with an in-depth research of Tesla's website design and structure to understand the key elements that shape their user experience. Next, I created wireframes and initial layouts in Figma, ensuring simplicity and efficiency of design. After that, I developed visual elements, such as full-screen images and typography, and customized every detail to match Tesla's design standards. The process continued with the creation of interactions and smooth transitions, ensuring dynamic and responsive navigation.
