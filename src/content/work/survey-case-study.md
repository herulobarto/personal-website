This project is a personal exercise based on a YouTube tutorial that simulates a survey of professionals working in the data field. The dataset was collected through a Google Form as part of the tutorial material, and I used it to practice end-to-end data analysis using Power BI.

The workflow started with cleaning the data—removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting columns for analysis. I then explored key insights such as average age, salary by job title, job satisfaction, salary satisfaction, and preferred programming languages (Python being the most popular).

To present the findings, I designed interactive dashboards in Power BI that allow users to filter and explore the results. This exercise helped me strengthen my skills in data preparation, visualization design, and analytical thinking within a realistic case study setting.
