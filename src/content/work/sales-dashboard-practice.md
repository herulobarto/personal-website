  I practiced data visualization using a publicly available dummy dataset on U.S. regional sales and profits (2014â€“2019). The project focused on Tableau dashboards with interactive and print-ready layouts.

The project started with importing the sales and profit dataset from 2014 to 2019 into Tableau. After the data was cleaned and processed, an analysis was conducted to evaluate total sales and profits by region in the United States. Bar charts were created to display the profit and sales comparisons of the four regions, with the finding that the West region had the highest sales and profit contribution. In addition, trend charts were created to show the changes in sales and profits from 2014 to 2019 as well as predictions of future performance.

Another visualization in the form of a map chart shows the distribution of sales by geographic location, with California as the region with the highest sales (marked in green) and the region with the lowest sales marked in dark red. The map chart has an interactive feature that allows users to click on the location to open additional information on Wikipedia, for example, by clicking on New York. All the analysis is summarized in a dashboard that is customized to A4 size for easy printing into PDF format for formal reporting needs.
