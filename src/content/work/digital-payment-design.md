The project started with a brainstorming session to identify the user needs of the digital payment application, such as Create account, Login application, Home Screen, Top Up feature, Transaction history and Payment feature. From the ideas generated, initial wireframes were designed using Whimsical to map out the workflow and ensure each design element meets the user needs. This process helped create a solid foundation for further design development.

Once the wireframes were complete, an app prototype was designed in Figma with a focus on a modern, intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface. The prototype is then tested through Maze Design to get direct feedback from users, identify potential obstacles, and ensure an optimal user experience before finalizing the design.
