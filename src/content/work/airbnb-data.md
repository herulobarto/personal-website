The project began by loading the Airbnb Seattle 2016 dataset into Tableau, followed by data cleaning and transformation processes such as removing duplicates and ensuring consistent data formatting. Initial analysis was conducted to explore the distribution of properties by number of bedrooms, average price, and location data by zip code.

The analysis found that there were 6 types of bedrooms, with the highest number of 1-bedroom properties at 1,811 units. The highest average price was found for 6-bedroom properties at $584.8. The zip code analysis showed that the 98119 zip code had the highest average price. The visualization also includes a graph of weekly earnings throughout 2016, which shows stability but experienced a significant increase in the last week of November to December. All these findings were visualized through Power BI using map charts, interactive graphs into dashboards.
